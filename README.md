# Movie Recommendation System using TMDB Database

This repository contains code and resources for a content-based movie recommendation system that utilizes the TMDB (The Movie Database) database. The recommendation system suggests movies to users based on their preferences and the content analysis of movies.

## Features

- Utilizes the TMDB database: The recommendation system leverages the extensive TMDB database, which provides detailed information about movies, including genres, plot summaries, cast, crew, ratings, and more.

- Content-based filtering: The system focuses on content-based filtering techniques to recommend movies. It analyzes the content of movies, such as genres, keywords, and plot summaries, to identify similar movies and make personalized recommendations.

- User preferences: The recommendation system considers the preferences of individual users. It takes into account the movies the user has already watched, liked, or rated to generate accurate recommendations tailored to their tastes.

- Movie similarity analysis: The system applies various similarity measures, such as cosine similarity, to identify movies that share similar characteristics. It then recommends movies that are most similar to the ones the user has shown interest in.

## Requirements

To run the movie recommendation system, you need the following:

- Python 3.7 or above
- Pandas
- NumPy
- scikit-learn
- nltk
